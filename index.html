    <H2>Basic History Of Franchise</H2>

    <div><p> The Kansas City Chiefs have a rich legacy that began in 1960 as the Dallas Texans, a founding member of the American Football League (AFL). In 1963, the franchise relocated to Kansas City and was renamed the Chiefs. Under visionary owner Lamar Hunt, the team quickly rose to prominence, winning three AFL championships—including the final one in 1969—and capturing their first Super Bowl title in 1970 (Super Bowl IV). After decades of ups and downs, the Chiefs surged back into dominance in the 2010s, led by head coach Andy Reid and superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes. They won Super Bowl LIV in 2020, Super Bowl LVII in 2023, and again in Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, cementing their status as a modern NFL dynasty.</p></div>
